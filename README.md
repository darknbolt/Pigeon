# simpleMessagingApp

These are two programs - server and client that manage simple messaging abilities. Clients connect to the server of their choosing (or 'default') and are capable of messaging together. The server handles the filters to scan for any banned phrases, registry of clients and enables them to be able to explicitely message someone/s or exclude person/people from seeing a message. The server also enables admins on their end to add/remove any banned words dynamically.
